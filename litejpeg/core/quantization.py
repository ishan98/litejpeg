"""
Quantization Module
===================
In this quantization module, we are dividing our matrix with certain values
as per the quantization table to increase the number of zeros that is used
in the compression in the next stages. However instead of dividing which
creates a problem because of non-storage of decimal values as such in a signal,
We are going to multiply the values with the inverse of the values within
the matrix and give the output for the next stage.
